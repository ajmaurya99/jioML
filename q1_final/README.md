### auto_fill_data.json Assignment no - 1

I have used Python and Flask to solve this assignment.

- Command to run the App
- env FLASK_APP=driver_code.py flask run

- Searching the string from json file
    - http://127.0.0.1:5000/app/<your string>
    - For eg - http://127.0.0.1:5000/app/what is (A query for the string 'what is')
